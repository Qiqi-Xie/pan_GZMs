# Comprehensive Study on the Role of Granzyme Family in Cancer
This repository contains original data and code used in our study related to the role of Granzyme (GZM) gene family in the immune response against tumor cells that spans across various types of cancer including triple-negative breast cancer.

## About The Study
Our study dives deep into the function of the GZM gene family and its involvement in inflammation, tumor development, and various survival pathways. Through a comprehensive analysis leveraging cancer genome mapping data, we have observed a differential expression of the GZM gene family in tumors.

## Key Findings 

1. GZM gene family has a strong positive correlation with PD-1 expression in various cancers.
2. Development of GZMscores to understand the function of GZM gene family in cancer.
3. Close associations between GZMscores and multiple immune and inflammatory pathways.
4. High GZMscores are predictive of poor prognosis in diverse tumors.
5. Single-cell pan-carcinoma analysis highlights GZM gene family's influence on tumor immunity and recruitment of effector T cells.
6. Multiomics and single-cell analysis revealed the potential of harnessing the GZM gene family for enhancing patient immunotherapy responses.
